# titanic-survival-prediction-streamlit

This is my Machine Learning Project that helps me understand and explore the world of Machine Learning as a beginner. 

It uses 3 models namely: Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. 

**How to run**

1. Create a project folder and set up a virtual environment.
2. Install necessary modules for tarining.py and titanic_app.py.
3. Run training.py: This is will create 3 .pkl files for each model.
4. Execute command 'streamlit run titanic_app.py' on the terminal of the projet.
